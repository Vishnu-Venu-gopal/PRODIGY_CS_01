# Task-01
Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption

## Ceaser Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a classic example of ancient cryptography that involves shifting each letter of a plaintext message by a certain number of letters, historically three.  It is a type of substitution cipher where one letter is substituted for another in a consistent fashion. The earliest known use of a substitution cipher, and the simplest, was by Julius Caesar. The Caesar cipher involves replacing each letter of the alphabet with the letter standing three places further down the alphabet.
